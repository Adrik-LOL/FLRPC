# FL Studio Discord RPC

A simple, yet cool way to show off your FL Studio projects to your friends and others.


## Features

- Secret mode (meaning others can't see what project you're working on)
- Optional accurate FL Studio version (ex. FL Studio 20.8.4.1873)
- A JSON-based easy-to-manage configuration system
- Very lightweight and resource efficient
- Uses only 2 external packages
- Almost everything is commented, so the code is easily manageable and readable

## (Current) Cons
- No integration into actual FL Studio (meaning it must run in the background as a console app)
- Has very little features as of now

## Installation

You can either simply run the pre-compiled release, or build it yourself! I currently use .NET Framework 4.8.1 (although you could probably downgrade it if you build the project yourself)
